### A little trivia for the interested -

- 🌱 I’m currently learning MIPS Assembly, linux development and Advanced Datastructures in C/C++
- 🐯 I'm enrolled at WSU (Go Cougs!) as a Freshman, going for my BS in Computer Science
- 🐺 Ironically my sister just got accepted to UW (Screw The Huskies!) so there is a little sibling rivalry there
